# Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Logistic Regression

This repository contains the ipynb file for a machine learning model used to predict the sentiment analysis of a tweet on the popular website 'X'(formerly Twitter).
It uses **Logistic Regression** to create a model to analyse he tweet. 
The dataset used has been pulled using an API request from **Kaggle**.
This project has been made on Google Colab.

## Libraries used
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Sklearn:
      1. feature_extraction
      2. model_selection
      3. linearmodel
      4. metrics
4. nltk:
      1. nltk.corpus
      2. nltk.stem.porter
   

## Results
The **accuracy score** of the model is about 77%. This means for every 100 entries, the model will accurately predict 77 of them.
